# Alarm_Clock

This alarm clock was designed as our Assignment Project.

# Features:
 ### 1. You can set the alarm, and be sure that you will get up. This alarm clock helps you to get up on time by making you perform physical activity of walking 10-15 steps in order to stop the alarm.
 ### 2. You can choose ringtone of your choice from the given 4 options. (`Dynamic Options will be added soon`)
 ### 3. It uses the inbuilt pedometer and accelerometer sensors to sense the steps while the alarm is ringing.
 
# Testing Environment:
 ### I have used Android Studio to make the application and it has been successfully tested on all the API levels on or above 21.
 ### App uses Material theme, so make sure you first fix the import issues for the Material API in case you have any.(Android Studio performs it automatically)
 ### SDK Build version: 
      1. minSdkVersion 21 
      2. targetSdkVersion 28
      3. CompiledSdkVersion 28
